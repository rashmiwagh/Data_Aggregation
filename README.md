<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I am creating this project to show various aggreagate function such as COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVERAGE along with WHERE clause using Python.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* With the help of this quideline it will be easier to generate your own code and you don't have to work from scratch

  I'll be adding more content and more complex function in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this project!
